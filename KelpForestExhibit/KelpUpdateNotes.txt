These are the changes I've made to Kelp:
08 Oct 02
  - KelpForestMain.x3d calls KelpNoBase.x3d
  - KelpNoBase calls kelp_proto.wrl#Kelp

09 Oct 02
  - translated kelp_proto.wrl to KelpPrototype.x3d run from command line Vrml97ToX3dNist.bat
  - IS's moved
  - duplicated inlines removed by defining inlines.
  - translated bulb.wrl to Bulb.x3d run from command line Vrml97ToX3dNist.bat
  - translated bulb_lowres.wrl to BulbLowResolution.x3d run from command line Vrml97ToX3dNist.bat
  - refrences to Bulb and BulbLowResolution updated in KelpPrototype
  - updated reference in KelpNoBase

Updated Files:
Bulb.x3d
BulbLowResolution.x3d
KelpPrototype.x3d
KelpNoBase.x3d

Old:
bulb.wrl
bulb_lowres.wrl
kelp_proto.wrl

Remaining issues:
Updata Meta in all files
value of zero in scale of BLADE_MOTION in Bulb.x3d
field values need for Kelp1
protoInstance naming not right in KelpNoBase

Other Files:
KelpClump2.x3d - Not used
FlexiKelp - updated in 2001, works fine, might have value



Gallery - not working * can't find any reference to origional author *
need to include image folder
GiantKelp.x3d updated missing header, transform names make no sense
CopperRockFish changed to CopperRockFishPlacardViewer
need to make one proto!
