# The following url is an ordered list of multiple addresses that support the following use cases.
# Use case: (1a) .x3d on local disk or (1b) web server query looks on local server
# Use case: (2) Older VRML97 browser unable to read X3D, reads .wrl version instead (backwards compatibility)
# Use case: (3) local copy not available, retrieve from permanent server address
# Use case: (4) combination of cases (2) and (3), VRML97 on remote server
# TODO consider simpler scene to illustrate Inline, also consider adding Viewpoint
